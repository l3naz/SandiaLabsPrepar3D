this repo should be inside the sdk / simconnect samples /
folder. Load up the SDK Samples.sln in Visual Studio. Only
through this can you build the projects. The first commit 
works on my end. You also have to make this a project inside of
the solution. The repo contents are an exact copy of the 
Managed Data Request package. It is in C# and so we should
continue developing in C# and adding different SimConnect
API calls. If you are having issues, I would recommend 
speaking to Bill. He had more knowledge on how to set up 
the Visual Studio than Rey and I. I think we should really try
and get a product to show on friday so lets all work hard this week!
